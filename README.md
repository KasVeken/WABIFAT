# WABIFAT
WABIFAT (WSClean, Aegean, Bane Interaction to create fluxdensity versus Frequency And Time plots) is a software capable of creating spectra and light curves of radio observations done telescopes such as LOFAR.

This software creates spectra and light curves from input .MS files resulting from radio observations of e.g LOFAR. 

It is not user friendly at the moment. I will be working on that.
